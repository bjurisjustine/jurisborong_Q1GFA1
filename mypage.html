    Hi! My name is  Juris Justine D. Borong. I am 14 years old. 
    I read books, watch shows, and study in my past time.
    I mostly read fanfictions or decent books from BookTok. 
    Though, in my opinion, fanfictions are more well-written and literate than BookTok books.
    I also spend my time in Starbucks Matina IT to study. I prefer studying outside since my house does not really provide the ambience that I need.

    My goal in life is to be a successful cosmetic chemist to the point that my name is well-known in the beauty industry. 
    Why do I want to work in the beauty industry? I believe that working in an environment that you're passionate in will help you thrive. 
    Thrive until you reach TRIUMPH.

    Also, I'm a huge Harry Potter nerd. LOL.
